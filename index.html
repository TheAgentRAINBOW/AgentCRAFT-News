<p>Generation 1 Reboot (Jesus, that went faster than expected.)<br>
<b>READY</b></p>
<p>Baka Boop Progress<br></p>
<progress value = "9.8" max = "100"></progress>
<br>
<h2>Generation 1 Continuation Confirmed</h2>
<p>The Skittle Horse Owner Man himself has confirmed Generation 2 to be halted in favour of continuing Generation 1.
<br>
Most of the server is set to be revamped (a new lobby may be built, depending if Skittles is lazy) partially,
<br>
mainly Unified Horn and a possible temporary decontinuation of Sunbopped Budgies.
<br>
Baka Boop progress is estimated to be grinded to almost a halt to allow progress to continue for the continuation.
<br>
<br>
This is Definetly Not Skittles, out.
<br>
<h2>Alek Messed Up</h2>
<p>Alek dad turned of PC during final weekend. Screw him.</p>
<p>That forgetful lad. XD</p>
<br>
<h2>The Last Weekend</h2>
<p>It's true. While the Owner is at Scout camp, he will leave the server on for a <b>FINAL WEEKEND.</b><br>Owner states that there is no need to worry. No one cares. He also states G2 may be have more minigames.<br>Kevin's screams can be heard in the background.</p>
<br>
<h2>The End <b>IS</b> Neigh!</h2>
<p>The end of AgentCRAFT Generation 1 <b>IS</b> imminent, confirmed by Owner.</p>
<br>
<h2>Server Not Online Today? (07/05/2018)</h2>
<p>Owner says "No one would have missed it anyway."
<br>
<h2>The End is Neigh? (Horse puns.)</h2>
<p>The end of Generation 1 of our network may be closer than expected!</p>
<p>If this is the case, the Baka Boop project would remain intact, says Owner.</p>
<br>
<h2>"Vote No" going around all over AgentCRAFT!</h2>
<p>People voting for no regarding abortion all over AgentCRAFT!</p>
