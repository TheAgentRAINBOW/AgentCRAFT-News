<h2>The Last Weekend</h2>
<p>It's true. While the Owner is at Scout camp, he will leave the server on for a <b>FINAL WEEKEND.</b><br>Owner states that there is no need to worry. No one cares. He also states G2 may be have more minigames.<br>Kevin's screams can be heard in the background.</p>
<br>
<h2>The End <b>IS</b> Neigh!</h2>
<p>The end of AgentCRAFT Generation 1 <b>IS</b> imminent, confirmed by Owner.</p>
<br>
<h2>Server Not Online Today? (07/05/2018)</h2>
<p>Owner says "No one would have missed it anyway."
<br>
<h2>The End is Neigh? (Horse puns.)</h2>
<p>The end of Generation 1 of our network may be closer than expected!</p>
<p>If this is the case, the Baka Boop project would remain intact, says Owner.</p>
<br>
<h2>"Vote No" going around all over AgentCRAFT!</h2>
